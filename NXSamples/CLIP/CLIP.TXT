   Compile the CLIP.CBL program to .INT format using the Net Express Project/
   Rebuild All menu choice.

   Run or animate the program CLIP.INT using the Net Express Animate menu
   choices or the relevant toolbar button.

   Once you have invoked the demo, follow the on-screen instructions.


   Extra Notes
   -----------

   When you compile a program from within the Net Express IDE, the
   INT and IDY files may (depending on your project's build type) be
   placed in a directory below your working directory. When running the
   demonstration outside of the IDE you must make sure the project build
   directory is on your COBDIR.
