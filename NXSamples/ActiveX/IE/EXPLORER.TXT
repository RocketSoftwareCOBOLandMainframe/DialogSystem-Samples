                         Micro Focus Dialog System V3

                   WebBrowser ActiveX Control Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The IEDEMO screenset is provided as an example of how to use a
   control program to add HTML page content (WebBrowser ActiveX Control) to you
   Dialog System application.

   The benefits of using this control are that you can vastly improve the
   presentation of your graphical interface and tailor an HTML page to
   appropriate users, whilst retaining the ability to use HTML elements in the
   context of your application.

   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied EXPLORER.APP file into your Net Express IDE and
   select the Project/Rebuild All menu choice.

   Before runnng the application you may need to edit the APP_NAVIGATE.HTM file
   to alter the SRC property of the images used on the HTML page. This is
   currently set to the relevant DialogSystem\Demo directory, but may need to be
   changed based on your installed location.


   Features
   --------

   The application starts by identifying the current directory location and,
   placing the relevant location & HTML page name into the screenset data block.

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the object
   defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point in the controls
   associated program. This program places the control on the newly created
   window.

   The demonstration makes the WebBrowser control navigate to the nominated HTML
   page and includes full details on configuring the control and manipulating it
   at runtime. Note that not all of the WebBrowser controls' properties and
   methods are available - see the Microsoft Internet SDK for full details.

   The manipulation functions cover most of the functionality provided by the
   control, in a context that Dialog System programmers will be familiar with
   based on use the CALLOUT function to a control program.

   Run the built application. The main window appears and the main window is
   shown with the HTML page loaded. Select any of the HTML elements.

   With the exception of the Micro Focus Home Page hyperlink, the HTML elements
   perform client application navigation via the registered WebBrowser event
   callback.

   For these events, the application determines the URL passed with the event,
   and using known delimiters based on the element type, the relevant event can
   be passed into the screenset, or otherwise used to negotiate the application.

   NOTE: These URL details passed with the event require the use of Internet
   Explorer 5 to function correctly.

   These manipulation functions are well documented in the dialog and COBOL
   code.


   Adding an ActiveX Control to your application
   =============================================

   This demonstration was created using the WebBrowser ActiveX
   control that you can paint on your application window, by selecting
   the Dialog System File/Import/ActiveX control menu choice. Select the
   Microsoft WebBrowser item in the displayed dialog. The control is then added
   to the Dialog System ActiveX toolbar palette. You can now paint the control
   on your application window.

   When the control is painted, the Control properties dialog appears, select
   the "Add program to current project" check box and the "Generate" push button
   to create the control program in your project.

   You can now tailor the control program to meet the needs of your application
   including the callback registration and navigation options as illustrated in
   this demonstration.

   Screenset Data import
   ---------------------

   If you have not used the New GUI Application Wizard to create your screenset,
   you will need to import the following files contained in the
   DialogSystem\Source directory:

       FUNCDATA.IMP    The generic communication area used by all control
                       programs
