   Features
   --------

   This demonstration shows how it is possible to maintain a menu bar
   at run time. The menu bar in this example is fully customizable (you
   can select which options appear on it). As you change the options, the
   menu bar is updated immediately.

   In most cases, applications will only be changing a few menu items
   dynamically, which can be implemented using just a few lines of dialog.

   Comments have been added throughout the demonstration to explain how
   it works.
