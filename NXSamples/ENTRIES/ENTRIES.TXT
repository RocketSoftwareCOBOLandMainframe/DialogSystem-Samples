   ENTRIES Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   The ENTRIES.CBL program drives the ENTRIES.GS screenset that you can
   create by following the chapter "No Programming Required" in the
   Dialog System User Guide. The chapter "Using the Screenset" explains
   the program itself. A completed version of this screenset is included
   as part of this example and can be used as a guide if you experience
   difficulty when creating your own.


   Files Required
   --------------

   The files needed to build and run the demonstration program are:

   Name of the file     Description of the file
   ----------------     -----------------------------------------------------
     ENTRIESX.GS          The completed ENTRIES screenset.

     ENTRIES.CBL          The cobol program to drive the demonstration.
      - ds-cntrl.mf       Dialog System control file.

     ENTRIES.TXT          This ENTRIES document

     ENTRIES.CPB          The Dialog System data block copyfile for ENTRIES.GS.

     ENTRIES.APP          The Net Express project file supplied with the demo.

   If you plan to run the completed version of the screenset (rather than
   creating your own) then rename entriesx.gs to entries.gs.


   Compiling and Running The Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------------------------

   In order to run the ENTRIES demonstration, you need to compile the
   ENTRIES.CBL demonstration program.

   Load the supplied Net Express project file and select Rebuild All
   from the Project menu.

   Run the demonstration by selecting Run from the Animate menu.


   Extra Notes
   -----------

   When you compile a program from within the Net Express IDE, the
   INT and IDY files may (depending on your project's build type) be
   placed in a directory below your working directory. When running the
   demonstration outside of the IDE you must make sure the project build
   directory is on your COBDIR.
