   ROUTER Demonstration Program
   ----------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   This ROUTER example shows how to use multiple screensets with Dialog
   System in an environment which does not have the ability to run
   subprograms concurrently.


   Files Required
   --------------

   The files needed to build and run the demonstration program are:

   Name of the file     Description of the file
   ----------------     -----------------------------------------------------
     PROGRAMA.GS          Screenset for program A.

     PROGRAMB.GS          Screenset for program B.

     PROGRAMC.GS          Screenset for program C.

     ROUTER.CBL           Main routing program.
      - router.cpy        Interface between main program and subprograms.

     PROGRAMA.CBL         Program A. This contains the menu.
      - router.cpy        Interface between main program and subprograms.
      - ds-cntrl.mf       Dialog System control file.
      - dssysinf.cpy      Dialog System system information file.
      - programa.cpb      Dialog System data block copyfile for PROGRAMA.GS.

     PROGRAMB.CBL         Program B. A subprogram.
      - router.cpy        Interface between main program and subprograms.
      - ds-cntrl.mf       Dialog System control file.
      - dssysinf.cpy      Dialog System system information file.
      - programb.cpb      Dialog System data block copyfile for PROGRAMB.GS.

     PROGRAMC.CBL         Program C. Another subprogram.
      - router.cpy        Interface between main program and subprograms.
      - ds-cntrl.mf       Dialog System control file.
      - dssysinf.cpy      Dialog System system information file.
      - programc.cpb      Dialog System data block copyfile for PROGRAMC.GS.

   Compiling and Running The Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------------------------

   In order to run the ROUTER demonstration, you need to compile the
   ROUTER.CBL, PROGRAMA.CBL, PROGRAMB.CBL, and PROGRAMC.CBL demonstration
   programs.

   Load the supplied Net Express project file and select Rebuild All
   from the Project menu.

   Run the demonstration by selecting Run from the Animate menu.

   Once you have invoked the demo, select the options from the menu bar
   to show the different screensets.


   Features
   --------

   The problem here is that the user can click in any window at any time.
   This means that if multiple programs with multiple screensets are in use
   then control has to be passed to the correct program and the correct
   screenset has to be in use by DSRUN.


   Passing control to the correct program
   --------------------------------------

   DSRUN is capable of detecting that an event has occurred in a screenset
   other than the one that is currently loaded. This is done via the
   OTHER-SCREENSET event which in this example is in the global dialog table
   for each screenset.

   When such an event is detected the REPEAT-EVENT function is used. This
   tells DSRUN to repeat the last event the next time it goes for input.
   This will in fact be when the next screenset is loaded and control is in
   the next program.

   After the REPEAT-EVENT the screenset returns to the program. The program
   has called DSRUN using the third parameter. This contains system
   information concerning the last event. Part of this information is the
   screenset identifier of the screenset in which the last event occurred.
   The program uses this information as the means of passing control via the
   ROUTER to the program that owns the event.


   Using the new correct screenset
   -------------------------------

   DSRUN has the concept of pushing and popping screensets. It holds the
   screensets on a stack. A feature is available so a screenset on the stack
   can be used even if it is not on top of the stack. This is done using the
   DS-USE-SET value in DS-CONTROL. The current screenset is placed on top of
   the stack and the screenset set to be used is loaded into DSRUN.


   Program structure
   -----------------

   The programs are written so when they are first called they use the
   DS-PUSH-SET control value to initialize them as a new screenset. Note
   that for the very first screenset DSRUN treats this as a DS-NEW-SET call.
   If the program is invoked at any other time it is assumed that the
   programs screenset is to be brought into use and so the DS-USE-SET
   control value is supplied.

   Apart from this the program contains an evaluate statement which is
   driven by flags from the screenset.

   Note that the ROUTER makes use of two data items to provide some control
   in the canceling of subprograms when they are closed.


   Extra Notes
   -----------

   In order to achieve the look and feel of a concurrent application it is
   important that each subprogram does not perform any long tasks that are
   not interruptable. If this happens then the impression will be that the
   user interface is not responding.

   When you compile a program from within the Net Express IDE, the
   INT and IDY files may (depending on your project's build type) be
   placed in a directory below your working directory. When running the
   demonstration outside of the IDE you must make sure the project build
   directory is on your COBDIR.
