		       Micro Focus Dialog System V3.0

		       Toolbar Control Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The TBARDS.GS screenset is provided as an example of how a class 
   library menu bar and toolbar can be added to your Dialog System 
   application using a user control.
   Control functions in TBAR.CBL can then be used to manipulate
   these controls. To enable menu hint text to be displayed, 
   a Status Bar has been included in the screenset and is implemented 
   as another user control using the program SBAR.
   
   The following extra features are available when using class library
   menus and toolbars instead of Dialog System menus and bitmaped buttons.

	- Hint text displayed on status bar for menu items.
	- When mouse is over a toolbar button, its associated menu hint
	  text is displayed.
	- Tool tips displayed when mouse is over a toolbar button.
	- New menu items can be inserted anywhere in the menu.
	- Implicit link between a toolbar button and its associated
	  menu item.
	- Menu events can be mapped directly onto COBOL code.

   One of the most important differences to note when using class library
   menus and toolbars is that each toolbar button has an associated
   menu item. When a toolbar button is selected a menu event is generated 
   by the class library for its associated menu item.
   Similarly, when a menu item is enabled, disabled, checked or unchecked,
   it's associated toolbar button is also.

   This demonstration also provides an example of how to delete a toolbar
   button when its associated menu item is deleted.

   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------
   
   Load the supplied TBAR.APP file into your Net Express IDE and select the Project,
   Rebuild All menu choice. The project is pre-configured to run the screenset using
   DSRUNNER, calls will be made to the controlling program in your project build directory.
  

   NOTES:

   1. When using Screenset Animator to debug TBARDS.GS it is
      advisable to edit the dialog for window WIN1 to comment out the
      line: "TIMEOUT 25 REFRESH-STATUS-BAR" which is part of the
      dialog for the WINDOW-CREATED event.

      If this line of dialog is not commented out, then Screenset
      Animator will loop executing the procedure "REFRESH-STATUS-BAR"
      indefinately, as this procedure is called every 1/4 of
      a second.

  

   Features
   --------

   This demonstration shows how it is possible to create and maintain a 
   class library menu and toolbar on a Dialog System application 
   window at run time. 
   A status bar has been included in this demonstration for the purposes 
   of displaying hint text. For more information on the status bar
   function calls used by this demonstration screenset, please refer
   to the topic "Control programs" in the help.

   The demonstration illustrates the use of function based CALLOUTs to 
   the toolbar control program TBAR.GNT. For more information on the
   toolbar function calls used by this demonstration screenset, 
   please refer to the topic "Control Templates" in the help.

   The toolbar has been defined on the window as a User Control object
   using the Dialog System definition software. The association between
   the user control object and the control template, TBAR.GNT, can be  
   seen by viewing the User Control Properties dialog box. 

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the user
   control object defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point
   in the user control's associated program - TBAR.GNT. This program places
   the menu and toolbar defined in tbardefn.cpy on the newly created window. 
   The copyfile tbardefn.cpy contains two data tables. The first table 
   contains data that defines the menu bar structure, the second table
   contains data that defines how the toolbar will look and which menu
   items the buttons are linked to.


   On Completion of the create process the control program registers event 
   callback/entry point code associations with the Class Library.

   The menu and toolbar in this demonstration show the use of features most
   commonly used such as accelerator keys, menu item mnemonics, sub menus,
   hint text and tool tips.

   Menu events can be mapped onto COBOL code to handle the event, which 
   can then send a Panels2 User Event to the window owning the menu bar 
   if required.
   For example, when "New" on the File pulldown is selected, a callback
   entry point is invoked which posts a user event to the Dialog System
   window to display a message box showing the menu text of the selected
   item (see the entry point code for "TBAROnItemSelected" in TBARCB.CPY
   for further information).

   It should be noted that associating more than one toolbar button on 
   the same toolbar with a single menu item may cause unpredictable results.
   This is a Win32 API restriction, and for this reason the demonstration 
   does not allow more than one toolbar button per menu item to be added.

   When using the demo, the ADD-MENU-ITEM function button can be used to 
   add a new menu item to the menu once the main structure of the menu 
   has been created. To add a menu item or sub-menu to the menu bar use
   a menu index of zero.
   To add a new menu item to display the help dialog box do the following: 
	
	1. Select the "ADD-MENU-ITEM" radio button.
	2. Enter the following values:
		Menu index:             14 (Index of "Toggle" menu item)
		Menu text               Help2
		Accelerator flags:      9 (KS-VIRTUAL-KEY + KS-CTRL-PRESSED)
		Accelerator key:        72 (ASCII value for "H")
		Callback entry name:    TBAROnHelp
		Menu hint text          Hint text for Help2

	3. Select the "After" radio button.
	4. Select the "Menu item" radio button.
	5. Press the "EXECUTE FUNCTION" button to add the new menu item.

	Select the "CheckMark" pull down menu to view the new menu item.


   The ADD-TOOLBAR-BUTTON function can be used to add a new toolbar
   button to the toolbar once the initial set of buttons has been
   added to the toolbar at window creation time.
   To add a new button to the toolbar and associate it with the Help2
   menu item refered to above, do the following:

	1. Select the "ADD-TOOLBAR-BUTTON" radio button.
	2. Enter the following values:
		Menu index              16 (Index of new "Help2" menu item)
		Insert button before    0 (Add to end of toolbar)
		Tool tip text           Tip for Help2
		Resource file           tbar (Bitmaps defined in tbar.dll)
		Resource ID             208
	3. Press the "EXECUTE FUNCTION" button to add the new button.

   To enable, disable or toggle the checkmark state of a menu item and
   its associated toolbar button (if any), select the appropriate radio
   button from the list of available functions and enter the menu index 
   of the menu item required. Press the "EXECUTE FUNCTION" button.

   To change the text of a menu item once created, select the
   "UPDATE-MENU-TEXT" radio button from the list of available functions, 
   enter its menu index, enter the new menu text in the menu text entry field 
   and press the "EXECUTE FUNCTION" button to apply the change.

   A menu item and its associated toolbar button (if any) can be deleted by
   selecting the "DELETE-MENU-ITEM" radio button, specifying its menu index 
   and pressing the "EXECUTE FUNCTION" button.


   Additional comments are available in the screenset and the control
   template source code.
