                        Micro Focus Dialog System V3

                      Text Entry Control Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The EFDEMO screenset is provided as an example of how to use a
   control program to add a Text Entry (Entry Field) control to your
   Dialog System application.

   The benefits of using a Programmed version of the Text Entry control, include
   the following:

       -   Full Overstrike/Insert support
       -   Full control and validation of every keystroke
       -   The ability to create a User defined edit field mask


   Files required
   --------------

   The files needed to run the demonstration program are:

   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied ENTRYFIELD.APP file into your NetExpress IDE and
   select the Project/Rebuild All menu choice.


   Features
   --------

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the object
   defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point in the controls
   associated program. This program places the control on the newly created
   window.

   This demonstration illustrates the use of two Text Entry fields, that are 
   associated to the same datablock master field as the Dialog System equivalent
   Entry Field objects.

   The controls are updated from the master field on GAINFOCUS and update the 
   master field on LOSTFOCUS. You can see how full Insert/Overstrike support is 
   provided by the Text Entry versions.


   Adding a Text Entry Control to your application
   ===============================================

   This demonstration was created using the programmable Text Entry control
   control that you can paint on your application window, by selecting
   the Programmed controls tab of the Dialog System toolbar palette.

   When the control is painted, the Control properties dialog appears, select
   the "Add program to current project" check box and the "Generate" push button
   to create the control program in your project.

   A single program can maintain multiple Text Entry Controls. You need to
   modify the generated code in the "TO DO" comment sections of the generated
   program. These modifications are detailed below.

   Full comments are available in the screenset and the generated control
   program source code.

   Screenset Data import
   ---------------------

   If you have not used the New GUI Application Wizard to create the Text Entry 
   control program, you will need to import the following files contained in 
   the DialogSystem\Source directory:

       FUNCDATA.IMP    The generic communication area used by all control
                       programs


   Modifications required
   ----------------------

   The generated program has comments containing "TO DO" items, and you need to
   modify the program to enable each Text Entry you require to be correctly
   linked to your required data block master field.

   These simple modifications are well documented in the source code - search
   for "TO DO" - and are as follows:

       -   On field creation, modify the properties of the created fields
           to include Autoswipe/UPPERCASE etc settings as required.

       -   On field creation, set the field length to a value appropriate to the
           master field you wish to link it to.

       -   For field GAINFOCUS and LOSTFOCUS events callback code,
           (Setup-Field-Data section) specify the master field name and length
           to be used when placing/retrieving the master field values in/from
           the Text Entry.
