		      Status Bar Control Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The SBARDS.GS screenset is provided as an example of how to use the 
   control template SBAR.GNT to add a status bar control object to your
   Dialog System application.

   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------
   


   Load the supplied SBAR.APP file into your Net Express IDE and select the Project
   Rebuild All menu choice. The project is pre-configured to run the screenset using
   DSRUNNER, calls will be made to the controlling program in your project build
   directory
  

   NOTES:

   1. When using Screenset Animator to debug SBARDS.GS it is
      advisable to edit the dialog for window WIN1 to comment out the
      line: "TIMEOUT 25 REFRESH-STATUS-BAR" which is part of the
      dialog for the WINDOW-CREATED event.

      If this line of dialog is not commented out, then Screenset
      Animator will loop executing the procedure "REFRESH-STATUS-BAR"
      indefinately, as this procedure is called every 1/4 of
      a second.

  

   Features
   --------

   This demonstration shows how it is possible to create and maintain a 
   status bar control on a Dialog System application window at run time. 
 
   The demonstration illustrates use of both CALLOUT to the status
   bar control template and use of the INVOKE dialog function to
   manipulate the control.

   The status bar has been defined on the window as a User Control object
   using the Dialog System definition software. The association between
   the user control object and the control template, SBAR.GNT, can be  
   seen by viewing the User Control Properties dialog box. 

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the user
   control object defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point
   in the user control's associated program - SBAR.GNT. This program places
   the status bar on the newly created window. 
 
   The WINDOW-CREATED event has dialog which automatically performs a
   callout to the control program to register event callback/entry point
   code associations with the Class Library.

   The status bar in this example is divided into five sections as follows:

      1st section - This section is setup to display any hint text for menu
		    items or mouse-over events on controls.

		    Note: Dialog System menus do not support hint text,
		    although hint text is displayed when you click on the 
		    system menu for the window. Hint text can be set for 
		    menus created by the OO GUI API class library.

		    For an example of how to create a class library menu
		    on a Dialog System window, please refer to the topic
		    "Tool Bar Control" in your Dialog System help.

      2nd section - Displays the current status of the INSERT key.

      3rd section - Displays the current status of the CAPS LOCK key.

      4th section - Displays the current status of the NUM LOCK key.

      5th section - This last section is used to display the current system
		    time.

   This demonstration gives an example of one of the events that a status
   bar can receive. Clicking on a particular section of the status bar with
   the left mouse button will display a message box showing which section 
   number (1 through 5) was clicked on (see the entry point code for 
   "sBarButton1Down" in SBAR.CBL for further information).

   The WINDOW-SIZED Dialog System event is used in this demonstration to 
   show how the sections of the status bar can be re-sized when the status
   bar's parent window is re-sized (see the code template procedure
   "Resize-Status-Bar-Sections" for further information).

   The Dialog System TIMEOUT function is also used here to demonstrate how
   the key state and current system time information can be refreshed to 
   keep the information up-to-date.

   The Update push button can be used to set the text of a status bar 
   section which is specified by the associated section text entry field. 
   The section number to update is specified by the associated section 
   selection box.

   The Retrieve push button can be used to display in a read only entry 
   field, the text of a status bar section. The section number to retrieve
   from is specified by the associated section selection box.

   The CLEAR-OBJECT push button removes text from all sections of the 
   status bar apart from the sections showing the current key states
   and time. In this example, only section 1 will be cleared.

   To refresh the status bar with the current status of the INSERT, 
   CAPS LOCK and NUM LOCK keys including the current time, click on the
   REFRESH-OBJECT push button.

   The SET-MOUSE-SHAPE push button toggles between the mouse pointer 
   being an arrow and an hour glass while over the status bar.
   Once the demonstration window is initially displayed, click on the
   SET-MOUSE-SHAPE push button. Then move the mouse over part of
   the status bar at the bottom of the window. The mouse pointer will
   change from being an arrow, to being an hour glass while over the
   status bar. To change the pointer back to an arrow, just click on
   the SET-MOUSE-SHAPE push button again. You will see that moving the
   mouse pointer over the status bar leaves the pointer as an arrow.

   The SET-FONT push button sets the font used by text on the status bar
   to SYSTEM 10 point. This demonstrates a very simple example of how
   to set the font for a control. Note that it is the responsibility of
   the application to finalize new fonts that have been created when they
   are no longer needed. In this demonstration screenset the example
   shows how to set a font and finalize it when the parent window for the
   status bar is deleted.

   Where a pushbutton is preceded with an *, this indicates that the
   function has been implemented using the INVOKE dialog function to
   directly invoke the required Class Library method on the status bar
   object. Although these functions are also implemented in the control
   template, and can be called using the procedural CALLOUT dialog 
   function, an example of using the INVOKE dialog function has been 
   inlcuded to make you aware that Dialog System can interface directly
   with the Class Library.

   Each of the following function push buttons perform the equivalent 
   Dialog System functions on a status bar:

     - HIDE-OBJECT
     - SHOW-OBJECT

   Additional comments are available in the screenset and the control
   program source code.
