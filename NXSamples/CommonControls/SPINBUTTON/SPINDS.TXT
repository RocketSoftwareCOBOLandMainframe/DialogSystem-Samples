                    Spin Button Control Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The SPINDS.GS screenset is provided as an example of how to use the 
   control template SPINBTN.GNT to add a spin button control object to
   your Dialog System application.

   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied SPINBTN.APP file into your Net Express IDE and select the Project
   Rebuild All menu choice. The project is pre-configured to run the screenset using
   DSRUNNER, calls will be made to the controlling program in your project build 
   directory.

  
   Features
   --------

   This demonstration shows how it is possible to create and maintain one
   or many spin button controls on your Dialog System application windows
   at run time.

   The demonstration illustrates use of both CALLOUT to the spin button 
   control template and use of the INVOKE dialog function to manipulate
   the control. 

   Each spin button has been defined on the window as a User Control object
   using the Dialog System definition software. The association between
   the user control objects and the control template, SPINBTN.GNT, can be  
   seen by viewing the User Control Properties dialog box for each user 
   control. 

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the user
   control objects defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point
   in the user control's associated program - SPINBTN.GNT. This program places
   the spin button controls on the newly created window. 
 
   The demonstration does not support the use of negative numbers in any of
   the spin buttons, although the spin button itself does.

   The entry fields used in this demonstration are not validated. This means
   that anything can be typed into the entry fields.

   The WINDOW-CREATED event has dialog associated which automatically does
   a callout to the control template. 

   The valid range for the main spin button is set by placing the required
   values in the minimum and maximum value spin buttons, and then clicking
   on the SetRange push button. The position of the main spin button is set
   by placing the required values in the position spin button, and then
   clicking on the SetPosition push button. Note that changing the value of
   the main spin button will also change the position spin button.

   The SetRange pushbutton uses the minimum and maximum range values, and
   the SetPosition pushbutton uses the position value. The other pushbuttons
   do not require any values to be set.

   Where a pushbutton is preceded with an *, this indicates that the function
   has been implemented using the INVOKE dialog function to directly invoke
   the required Class Library method on the spin button object. Although
   these functions are also implemented in the control template, and can be
   called using the procedural CALLOUT dialog function, an example of using
   the INVOKE dialog function has been inlcuded to make you aware that Dialog
   System can interface directly with the Class Library.

   Additional comments are available in the screenset and the control 
   program source code.
