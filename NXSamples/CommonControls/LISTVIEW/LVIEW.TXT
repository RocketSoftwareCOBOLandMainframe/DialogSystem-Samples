                        Micro Focus Dialog System V3

                         List Control Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The LVDEMO screenset is provided as an example of how to use a
   control program to add a List control (List View Control) to your
   Dialog System application.

   The benefits of using a Programmed version of the list control, rather than
   making use of the DSCNR Dialog System Extension is that it gives you full
   programmatic control over all aspects of the control including API access if
   needed.

        LVIEW.APP            The Net Express project file

        LVIEW.TXT            This document.


   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied LVIEW.APP file into your Net Express IDE and
   select the Project/Rebuild All menu choice.


   Features
   --------

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the object
   defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point in the controls
   associated program. This program places the control on the newly created
   window.

   The demonstration populates a List Control from a sequential data file, and
   includes full details on configuring the control and manipulating it at
   runtime.

   The manipulation functions cover most of the functionality provided by the
   control, in a context that Dialog System programmers will be familiar with
   based on use of the List Box object.

   Run the built application. The main window appears and the list control is
   populated with data. Select the "Test Functions" push button.

   A window appears which contains  push buttons which execute functions on the
   control. Where a function has input/output parameters these are input using
   the entry fields on this window.

   These manipulation functions are well documented in the dialog and COBOL
   code and additional documentation is available for the List View class
   via the Net Express help.


   Adding a List Control to your application
   =========================================

   This demonstration was created using the programmable List View
   control that you can paint on your application window, by selecting
   the Programmed controls tab of the Dialog System toolbar palette.

   When the control is painted, the Control properties dialog appears, select
   the "Add program to current project" check box and the "Generate" push button
   to create the control program in your project.

   A single program can maintain multiple List View Controls, although in
   practice you will probably choose to create seperate programs for each.

   In addition to placing calls in your application to establish the Column Headers
   and to populate the data, as illustrated in this demonstration, you also need
   to modify the generated code in the "TO DO" comment sections of the generated 
   program. These modifications are detailed below.

   Screenset Data import
   ---------------------

   If you have not used the New GUI Application Wizard to create the control
   program, you will need to import the following files contained in the
   DialogSystem\Source directory:

       FUNCDATA.IMP    The generic communication area used by all control
                       programs

       LVIEWDATA.IMP   The List View data block master fields used by the
                       control program


   Modifications required
   ----------------------

   The generated program has comments containing "TO DO" items, and you need to
   modify the program to enable each List Control you use, to be correctly
   configured to meet your requirements.

   These simple modifications are well documented in the source code - search
   for "TO DO" - and are as follows:

       -   Configure the Datablock Master groups and the associated
           Insert code sections to contain the number and format of the
           columns you require.

       -   On creation of the control, modify the properties of the List to
           include Gridlines/FullRowSelect etc as required

       -   If required you can enable the use of a Check box to be added to the
           1st column of each item in the list.

       -   If required you can enable the use of an Icon to be added to the 1st
           column of each item in the list. You then need to set up an icon
           resource DLL and provide an icon ID for each inserted item

       -   Code the criteria used for setting a column to right justified if
           required.

       -   For each event the control generates, tailor your screenset to detect
           the posted USER-EVENT if required.

       -   If required you can enable scrollbar tracking. This enables scroll
           events to be sent to the program, allowing 'paging' of data in and
           out of the control to cater for large volumes. You should experiment,
           and in practice this may not be required.
